# InternshipRecommendation

I have proposed a student skill based internship recommendation system where students are recommended a list of potential internships based on their skill set.
When a new internship is posted by the company, based on the company requirement the system will recommend the internship to the students having those required skills and 
push notification through email. In this system I am using jaccard similarity to create the ranking framework.
When one student apply the particular internship ,the system will show the matching skill percentage to the company.
When one company accepts the studentâ€™s application , the system will generate one certificate of acceptance and send the certificate to the particular student.
